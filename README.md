This is a coding Challenge:
Write a function to generate all the integer values from 1...n  exactly once, where n is the input. Using random function random() that returns floating point value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

void generateRandomNumbers( Integer  n)  --> prints list of integers from 1..n in random order   

I have written the coding in both Java and python.
